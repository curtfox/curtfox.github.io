I'm currently a PhD student in computer science working with Mark Schmidt at the University of British Columbia. My research area is in optimization for machine learning. I have conducted research looking at a variety of topics, such as the Edge of Stability phenomenon in deep learning, line search methods, random reshuffling, proximal gradient methods, adaptive preconditioners, deep research, as well as transformers and their use in next token prediction for language tasks. In addition to my research, I enjoy playing computer games, going to the arcade, taking long walks outside, learning about history, and eating a variety of food.
